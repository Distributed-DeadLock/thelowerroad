The Lower Road (a Minetest Mod)
====================

Adds a long road from -Z to +Z to the world, during world-generation.

The road partially follows the terrain and tunnels through higher ground otherwise.

The road materials depend on the environment. 

Small amounts of loot can be found in little buildings beside the road.

Per default the road will be generated at around x = 100.


Version: 1.0

License: The MIT License (MIT)

Dependencies: default, stairs, farming (found in minetest_game)

Download from: https://github.com/Distributed-DeadLock/thelowerroad

Not compatible with Mapgen v6!!

Installation
------------
Unzip the archive, (optionally rename the folder to thelowerroad) and
place it in minetest/mods/

Activate this mod when generating a new world.
The road is generated during world-generation, so
activating it on already existing worlds might not generate one.

You can change the x-position of the road and some other parameters in the top of the init.lua file.
